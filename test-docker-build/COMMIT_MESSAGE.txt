Fix Docker build with properly configured Go modules

- Created Dockerfile.proxy that builds the proxy service correctly
- Used proper Go module handling with vendoring in the Dockerfile
- Updated docker-compose.simple.yml to use the new Dockerfile
- Added test scripts to verify the build process
- Fixed shared package dependency resolution in Docker context

The build now correctly resolves the shared celestial package dependency
by using proper Go module handling with vendoring and a multi-stage build.
