# Docker Build Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
- The Docker build was failing due to Go module resolution problems with the shared celestial package
- The proxy service depends on the shared/celestial package but couldn't find it during Docker builds

## Changes Made

1. Created a new `Dockerfile.proxy` that:
   - Uses the entire repo as context to access both proxy and shared code
   - Properly handles the shared module with Go modules and vendoring
   - Builds the proxy service with all dependencies correctly resolved
   - Uses multi-stage build for a smaller final image

2. Modified `docker-compose.simple.yml` to:
   - Update the build context to the repo root
   - Use the new Dockerfile.proxy

3. Created test scripts to verify the build works correctly

## Testing
- Successfully built the Docker image with the new Dockerfile
- Validated the docker-compose configuration

## Next Steps
1. Consider updating the main Dockerfile to use this approach
2. Add this Dockerfile.proxy to the repository for future use
3. Update documentation to reflect these changes
