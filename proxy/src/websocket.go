// NOTE: WebSocket functionality is planned but not currently implemented.
// The code below is a placeholder for future implementation.
// 
// When implemented, this will handle WebSocket proxy connections with
// celestial latency, similar to how HTTP requests are handled.
// 
// Implementation requires:
// - Proper connection handling
// - Message proxying with latency simulation
// - Error handling
// - Integration with the main HTTP handler
//
// For now, these are omitted to avoid linting errors.
